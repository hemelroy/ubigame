# 2D Game: Area 51 Raid Training Simulator

This 2D avoid-the-enemy type game was developed using Ubisoft's Hacker's Nest game engine. The objective was to explore the theme of the unknown. Our take involved leaping into the mysteries of Area 51. 

Features:
 - Implemented an "endless-game" style with a scoring system and sustainable game play
 - Enemies randomly spawn in new locations and will run at the player at various speeds
 - Collision detection and knock-back added for enemies and game board boundaries
 
How to Play:
 - Avoid the guards for as long as you can. You can run around the entirety of the stage, just make sure you don't get knocked back past the left edge of the screen. Then it's game over.
 - Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate your player around the stage
 - Enemies will run at various speeds, coming from different locations. Avoid them.
